    "### Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a bank is interested in predicting their customer behavior regarding their preferences for subscribing to a _bank term deposit_. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What is a term deposit and why does someone want to invest their money?**\\\n",
    "Before answering these questions, let's look into some important definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Decision Problem faced by an Investor**\\\n",
    "An investor is a person who makes certain decisions regarding how he or she spends his or her money.\n",
    "* How much of my money should I use in consumption (goods or services) now?\n",
    "* From what is left, how much should I spend on investment opportunities?\n",
    "\n",
    "Such decisions are unscapable to the individual because resourses are limited. You only have a certain amount of money and you need to make decisions regarding how to spend it.\\\n",
    "We say that the investor faces a _trade-off_ between consuming less now to (hopefully) consume more in the future, i.e.:\n",
    "* Spend less in consumption at the beginning of a period in exchange for an investment opportunity that will hopefully earn profits at the end of the period.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(Economic) Incentives behind Consumer Behavior & Investment Opportunities**\\\n",
    "An _(Economic) Incentive_ is something that motivates or drives one to behave in a certain way. The most simple example in economics is: Prices.\\\n",
    "_Prices_ provide an incentive mechanism that might induce people's behavior in a certain way. For example, if the price of apples go up, you will probably buy less apples (and buy more of some other good or service).\\\n",
    "In periods of rising interest rates in society (usually started by the Central bank), consumers are more likely to invest because it is better to lend money to the bank than to spend it on consumption now. Thus, when the interest rate is higher, people tend to invest more, hence changing their status-quo behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debt-Based Financial Instruments**\\\n",
    "A financial instrument is an asset that can be traded between entities. An agreement (or contract) will hold both parties accountable for such transaction.\\\n",
    "We can divide financial instruments into different classes of financial instruments. An example is the _Debt-Based Financial Instruments_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Debt-Based Financial Instruments**\\\n",
    "The term _debt_ comes from the fact that some financial institutions want to raise capital by borrowing money from people. When this transaction happens, the financial institution has the obligation to pay back at a later date, with interest. Thus, the financial institution has a _debt_ with the lender.\n",
    "Such instruments can be understood as _certificate of deposits_, i.e., you _deposit_ money into an account at a financial institution for some period of time in exchange for future compensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Maturity**\\\n",
    "Maturity is the period of time it takes for the lender (you) to withdraw your money from the bank with interest. Maturity date is the agreed-upon date on which the investment ends.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fixed-term Investment**\\\n",
    "When a financial instrument has a fixed time period of investment, the maturity is known at the time of issuance and the lender cannot withdraw its money befeore maturity without incurring on a _early withdrawal penalty_.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Deposit**\\\n",
    "Term Deposit is an example of a _Fixed-Term, Debt-Based Financial Instrument_.\\\n",
    "In sum:\n",
    "* When a customer subscribes to a **Term Deposit** he or she will deposit (or invest) money on a bank account, agreeing not to withdraw their funds for a fixed period in return for future compensation (interest)."
